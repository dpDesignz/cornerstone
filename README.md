Download a copy of the repo and unzip it. Copy the `/system/cs-config-sample.php` file and rename it to `cs-config.php`, then fill out your Database settings as required.

You will need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install all the dependencies required to run your site.

Run the SQL file in your database and fill out the `site_url`, `site_https`, `site_name`, and `smtp_*` details in the `cs_options` table.
